####Bankapi
Banks don't allow to use their API in "open" manner.  
Using Bankapi you can download transactions from you account.  
Transaction acknowledgment mechanism based on this would compete with available payment solutions (0% commision!).  

Code is in very early stage of development, not yet usable.
Some tests (BDD flavoured) are added, some initial parsing mechanism is in place.  
Initial code architecture is introduced.

The project uses Selenium with headless browser to perform web-scrappings.  
Written with TDD in mind and Should library for some BDD-like assertions/naming.
